All node ID numbers in the map have been simplified, and their ID numbers are positive integers starting with 1. 
Just enter a simple number when entering the start point ID and end point ID.

The found shortest path data will be written to "path.dat" after execution. 
If you want to visualize the map and path, you need to put "path.dat" (generated shortest path data),  
"map_data.dat" (generate map data) and "instruction set.txt "(instruction script of gnuplot) to the "bin" 
folder of the gnuplot program. Then open gnuplot and type the instruction: load "Instruction set.txt" and
 see the generated path and map.
